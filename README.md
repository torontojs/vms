# Volunteer Management System (VMS)

The VMS is a platform for managing volunteers for Toronto JS and keeping track of a volunteer's history within Toronto JS.

## Goals

1. _Reduce friction for onboarding volunteers._ We want people to join us faster and easier.
2. _Improve observability by data._ We want to know what happened, when, and to whom.
3. _Have one single data source._ We want to have it as a single source of truth for data regarding volunteers, and have other tools consuming the VMS data.
4. _Provide a hands on experience for our members._ We want members of our community, specially those looking for jobs, to have a project experience.
