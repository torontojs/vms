# VMS Meeting - 2024-12-03

## Task updates

- Exploration of hosting suggested Cloudflare offers the best free option, basically fulfills all our needs
- For servers, neither Hono nor Fastify worked on Netlify. Express did however
- For testing, Bruno seems like the best option as it is OSS and saves plain text files
- We still have to decide on data storage option!

## Tech stack decisions

- We are going to test Cloudflare out
- Hono is the server of choice
- Bruno is almost certain, the only blocking issue is a display bug experiences by Manny

## Next steps

- Build basic server with Hono on Cloudflare
- Setup Toronto JS Cloudflare account
- Explore query builders and ORM options
- Investigate bug with Bruno
