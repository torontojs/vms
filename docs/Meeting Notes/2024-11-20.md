# VMS meeting notes - 2024-11-20

## Presenting the project and scope (15min)

### Initial Notes

- What the VMS is trying to solve
- Quickly go over existing requisites
  - Must have a separation between backend and frontend to allow for independent development
  - Backend should be API driven
  - Data should, preferably, be saved in plain json files
  - We have none to shoestring budget, so the solution must be as cost efficient as possible, preferably free
  - Maintainability is a strong requirement, so no "clever tricks" or super fancy tools that change constantly
  - Data ownership is a strong requirement, so we should be as standard and away from platform lock-in as possible
- Talk about requisites that you bring up to the meeting, please bring suggestions to the meeting

### Meeting Notes

- Discussion from [slack](https://torontojs.slack.com/archives/C0805K3R8VB/p1732034831290329): we would like to go with services that offer an idle timeout instead of connection limit
